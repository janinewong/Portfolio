        <h1>Objective</h1>
        <p><a href="www.westcoastsci.com" target="blank">Westcoast Sci Physiotherapy</a> is a Vancouver and Port Coquitlam based physiotherapy clinic offering services such as physiotherapy and therapeutic exercise. Our objective was to determine if the current clinic in the owner's home should be moved to an official location.</p>
        <p>If the decision was to move, we were to choose what location would be most profitable to keep their target market and gain new markets. We also needed to determine what marketing strategies we would propose for their company.</p>

        <!-- ==================== Target Market ==================== -->
        <div class="section">

          <div class="section-img">

            </a>
          </div>

          <h1>Existing Target Market</h1>

          <p>A majority of Westcoast Sci's target market consisted of weekend warriors with health benefit plans covered by their workplace (mostly hospital workers). Thus, we needed to keep these customers, as well as see if there was an opportunity to gain more.</p>
        </div>



        <!-- ==================== Customer Data ==================== -->

        <div class="section centered-section">

          <h1>Customer Data</h1>

          <p>Using the data from Westcoast Sci's customer transaction database, I created pivot tables organized by customer spending per year.</p>

            <!-- Project image 1 -->
            <div class="section-img">

              </a>

              <p class="centered extra-bot-pad">From this table, I was able to determine what each target market's spending habits per year would look like. The secondary market consisting of drop-in vistors would likely have no benefits or limited benefits, while the primary market would be spending much higher rates because of covered plans.</p>
              
            </div>


            <!-- Project image 2 -->
            <div class="section-img">

              </a>

              <br>
              <p class="centered">It is also important to note that this data includes the full year 2014, but only up to June 2015. Therefore, we can see how much the company has grown and the amount of revenue and number of customers spending more than $900 has increased only halfway through 2015.</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h1>New Target Market</h1>

        <p>After researching macro and micro factors in the industry and customer spending habits, we kept the primary market the same as the existing market of weekend warriors with extended health benefit plans. We proposed a new secondary market consisting of baby boomers and sports enthusiasts who would increase short term revenues.</p>
        <p>Baby boomers were most likely retired and could fill in the appointments during the day time while the primary market had most of their scheduled appointments after work hours. Data was also found positively linking sports enthusiasts to physiotherapy services in BC.</p>

            </a>

          </div>
        </div>

        <h1>Potential Clinic Location</h1>

        <p>We researched direct and indirect substitutes, as well as willingness to pay for physiotherapy services before choosing a potential clinic location. We narrowed it down to two locations: Port Coquitlam and Coquitlam. Although Port Coquitlam was growing with an average population around their 30-40s, Coquitlam had a much larger population with a greater amount of baby boomers.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, we chose Austin Station in Coquitlam because of its 5 minute drive from the center of Coquitlam, baby boomers living close by, and nearby recreational centres such as senior homes and the Vancouver golf club.</p>

        <!-- ==================== Results ==================== -->

        <div class="section">

          <h1>Results</h1>

          <p>Our client decided to pursue the Port Coquitlam location rather than the Coquitlam location.</p>

        <!-- ==================== Reflection ==================== -->

        <div class="section">

          <h1>Reflection</h1>

          <p>A huge takeaway I learned from this project was how to analyze data and compile it to make marketing decisions. I gained experience in making presentations for industry professionals and how to concisely communicate the information. This project enhanced my skills in Excel as well as skimming through many articles of information quickly. </p>
          <p>If I could do this project again, I would have prepared a more in-depth marketing plan for the client. Although the objective was to determine the location of the clinic, I would have personally liked to have expanded my knowledge in the creation of marketing plans/strategies.</p>
